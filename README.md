## Introduction

This project repository is dedicated to documenting my journey with the STM32 Development Kit. It includes a variety of experiments that showcase different functionalities and applications of the STM32 microcontrollers. The repository also contains projects developed using EdgeAI Studio, highlighting the process of training and optimizing AI models for embedded applications.

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Installation Manuals](Installation%20Manuals) folder. This section provides step-by-step guidelines on setting up the STM32 Development Kit and the necessary software tools.

## Experiments

The experiments conducted during this exploration are stored in the `MY_STM_workspace` directory. These experiments cover a range of topics, including:

- Basic GPIO operations
- ADC and DAC usage
- PWM generation
- UART communication
- I2C and SPI interfaces
- Timer and interrupt handling

Each experiment is accompanied by code and documentation to facilitate understanding and replication.

## EdgeAI Studio Projects

The repository includes two projects developed using EdgeAI Studio, which are compressed into zip files for easy access:

### Audio Classification

- **Project Files**: [audio-classification.zip](audio-classification.zip)
- **Description**: This project aimed to create an audio classification model to detect the type of weapon used in a battlefield scenario. Although the model's accuracy was not high enough to distinguish between different types of guns of the same kind, it could reliably indicate if a battle was occurring, similar to the functionality in the game Battleground Mobile India (BGMI).
- **Challenges**: The model faced challenges in accurately differentiating between similar-sounding weapons.
- **EdgeAI Studio Benefits**: EdgeAI Studio significantly streamlined the training process by automatically selecting the best-performing algorithms and discarding the less effective ones, thus saving considerable time and effort.

## Results
